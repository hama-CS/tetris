# Creating Tetris as a Learning Project
In this repository I will be trying to re-create and add my own version to the classic game of tetris

# My current plan is to use HTML and CSS for the visuals and JS for the functionality
This will help me strengthen my reletively new knowledge on these technologies while also figuring out how Git works.


# If I am able to complete the main functions in time:
Optional additions would be utilizing a database to impliment user account so that progress is saved.
Possibly a global highscore for daily, weekly and monthly scores.

# Feel free to request changes or impliment them and I will grant contributer status.
